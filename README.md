# designPatternsProjects-SSE
This repository is created for managing our design patterns projects.

Tag old_project is old version of our projects.

And our goal is reconstruct the old project to patterns.

Until now(2016-12-04 22:04:57),we have realized some useful design patterns, they are:

## 1. Factory pattern.
We use this pattern to create all kinds of enemies we need. You just need to tell how many typeA or TypeB or other enemies should be  created to factory, and the details could be coorperated by it. This pattern couold unify different objects's instantiationã€‚
  
## 2. Observer pattern.
It is necessary for our application to get some palyers' current situations(such as HP, is posioned, score) to show on screen timely. So we need an observer to monitor these information and refresh the show screen.

## 3. Facade pattern.
As our game need users control hero by keyboard, some people like up/down/left/right key, however, others may like W/A/S/D. So we add a function--The custom keyboard. And to realize this, we use the facade pattern. It is simple, just intercept users' operation functions and do some packaging to touch off the other function. Such as the user pressed the 'w', we will do some judgement. And according to users' settings(if is not settted, use default setting), we could do the corresponding operations.
    

And of course, we did a lot of jobs on project structure's improvement:

## 1. Decoupling.
We extract the players, enemies, GameHUD, and create the corresponding .h and .cpp files. With these works, the project's sructure is more clear than past.

## 2. Abstracting.
Some snippets we codded is not easy be called, which caused a lot of code redundancy. So we refactor this part to turn it to independent functions.

## 3. Normalizing.
We changed some hard known or naive classes, functions and attributes names to make them easy to understand.

That's all. Thanks.
